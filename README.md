# AI-Powered Calculator with Swarm

This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's **Swarm** agent-building platform to develop an AI-powered calculator. The process involves three distinct AI agents:

1. **Python Base Code Generator**: The first agent builds the core Python code for basic calculator operations.
2. **FastAPI Integration**: The second agent constructs an API layer on top of the Python code using **FastAPI** to expose the calculator functionalities as a web service.
3. **Gradio UI Builder**: The third agent creates a user-friendly interface with **Gradio** for interacting with the API.

## Overview

The development process includes using multiple tools and functions from Swarm to create the agents. The project was initially a trial, resulting in repeated usage of some tools, which will be streamlined in future versions by making the code more modular and reusing functions.

The following features are included:
- **Python-based Calculator**: Performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **FastAPI**: Exposes calculator functionalities through a RESTful API.
- **Gradio UI**: Provides a simple, interactive interface for the calculator.

### Key Learning

This project also includes a **Jupyter Notebook** where I experimented with the Swarm library to better understand how to build and execute AI agents. After exploring the platform, the coding AI agent was successfully executed, and the generated codes were uploaded here.

## Future Improvements

- Make the architecture more modular by creating reusable functions and tools.
- Optimize the agents to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
- Add more advanced operations to the calculator.
